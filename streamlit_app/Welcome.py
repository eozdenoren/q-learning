Welcome!

In this webpage, we will learn about Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning algorithm.

We will start with a simple example of a dog learning to find the bone in a 1D grid.

Then, we will explore a more complex example of a dog learning to find the bone in a 2D grid.

Finally, we will explore Q-learning's application in economics pricing strategies,
where two gas stations on a main road use algorithms to set fuel prices.

Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between the pages:

1. **Introduction** – Overview of Q-learning
2. **Dog & Bone Example** – interactive demonstration of Q matrix updating under "1D Grid" and "2D Grid" scenarios
3. **Economics Pricing Example** – application of Q-learning in economics pricing strategies
4. **Future Environment** – Placeholder for a more complex setup

It is recommended to use a desktop computer for the best experience.
